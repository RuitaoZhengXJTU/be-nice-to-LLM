# be-nice-to-LLM
There are ideas floating around about whether it improves LLM performance to be nice and say "thank you" to them or to be strict and commanding. There is empirical evidence for both views but I don't think we have a definitive answer yet. Why is that? Can we do a meta-study to see which side is more convincing?
