To solve the given nonlinear programming problem, we can use optimization techniques. However, as a text-based AI, I cannot perform real-time calculations or optimizations directly. Instead, I can guide you on how to set up and solve this problem using a programming language like Python with libraries such as SciPy or CVXPY.

Here's how you can set up the problem in Python using SciPy's `minimize` function:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Objective function
def objective(x):
    return np.sum(x**2) + 0.1 * np.sum(x)

# Constraints
def constraint1(x):
    return x[0] + 2*x[1] + x[2] - 1  # >= 1

def constraint2(x):
    return 2 - (x[3]**2 + x[4]**2)  # <= 2

def constraint3(x):
    return 5 - (x[5] + x[6] + x[7] + x[8] + x[9])  # <= 5

# Initial guess
x0 = np.zeros(10)

# Bounds for each variable
bounds = [(-3, 3) for _ in range(10)]

# Constraints in dictionary form
con1 = {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': constraint1}
con2 = {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': constraint2}
con3 = {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': constraint3}
constraints = [con1, con2, con3]

# Solve the optimization problem
solution = minimize(objective, x0, bounds=bounds, constraints=constraints)

# Prepare the result as a JSON object
result = {
    "x": solution.x.tolist(),
    "objective_value": solution.fun
}

print(result)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Objective Function**: The function `objective` computes the value of the objective function you want to minimize.
2. **Constraints**: Each constraint is defined as a function that returns a value. For inequality constraints, the function should return a value greater than or equal to zero when the constraint is satisfied.
3. **Initial Guess**: `x0` is the starting point for the optimization.
4. **Bounds**: Each variable is bounded between -3 and 3.
5. **Minimization**: The `minimize` function from SciPy is used to find the optimal solution.
6. **Result**: The solution is formatted as a JSON object.

### Note:
You will need to have Python and the SciPy library installed to run this code. The output will give you the optimal values of the variables and the optimal objective value in the specified JSON format.
