To solve the given nonlinear programming problem, we can break it down into its components. The objective is to minimize the sum of the squares of 100 variables \( x[i] \) subject to 20 constraints that require the sum of all variables to be non-negative. Each variable is also bounded between -10 and 10.

### Problem Formulation:
- **Objective Function**: 
  \[
  \text{minimize } f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{100} x[i]^2
  \]
  
- **Constraints**: 
  \[
  \sum_{i=1}^{100} x[i] \geq 0 \quad \text{(repeated 20 times)}
  \]

- **Bounds**: 
  \[
  -10 \leq x[i] \leq 10 \quad \text{for all } i
  \]

### Solution Approach:
1. **Understanding the Objective**: The objective function is minimized when the values of \( x[i] \) are as close to zero as possible, given the constraints.
2. **Constraints**: Since the constraint is repeated, we only need to satisfy it once. The simplest way to satisfy the constraint while minimizing the objective function is to set the sum of the variables to zero.
3. **Variable Bounds**: The variables can take values between -10 and 10.

### Optimal Solution:
To minimize the sum of squares while satisfying the constraint, we can set half of the variables to a negative value and the other half to a positive value, ensuring that their sum is zero. A simple solution is to set:
- \( x[1] = x[2] = ... = x[50] = -10 \)
- \( x[51] = x[52] = ... = x[100] = 10 \)

This satisfies the constraint:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{100} x[i] = 50 \times (-10) + 50 \times 10 = -500 + 500 = 0
\]

### Objective Value Calculation:
The objective value can be calculated as:
\[
\text{objective value} = 50 \times (-10)^2 + 50 \times (10)^2 = 50 \times 100 + 50 \times 100 = 5000 + 5000 = 10000
\]

### JSON Output:
The solution can be represented in JSON format as follows:
